# team-generator-CLA

## Description 

This project is developed as a command-line application that prompts the user about team members and their information, generating an HTML webpage that displays said the report. 

This project enabled me to improve further my knowledge of using nodes and utilizing classes in javascript. Furthermore, this also helped me experience tests and their uses when developing programs. The tests were run through jest and ensured that my classes were appropriately written.
